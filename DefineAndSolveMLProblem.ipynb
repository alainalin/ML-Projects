    "2. I would like to predict the overall rating of an Airbnb listing. The label column within the dataset will be a transformed version of the 'review_scores_rating' column or the overall review rating for a given listing. The transformed version will have integer values ranging from 0 to 5.\n",
    "3. This is a supervised learning problem since I will have a target label to predict (rather than just trying to learn some pattern/grouping/clustering of the data). The project will also be a multiclass classification problem (classes being integer values 0 to 5 inclusive).\n",
    "4. The features will include: 'host_response_rate', 'host_is_superhost', 'neighbourhood_group_cleansed', 'room_type', 'accommodates', 'bathrooms', 'bedrooms', 'beds', 'amenities', 'price', 'review_scores_cleanliness', 'review_scores_checkin', 'review_scores_communication', 'review_scores_location', and 'review_scores_value'. I selected these features based off of intuitions about what review writers would most likely consider when evaluating their rating of a given listing. For example, the Airbnb's host's name is likely not a consideration when rating their Airbnb. Intuition is not fail proof however and there may be other factors that are influential.\n",
    "5. Highly rated Airbnb's are more attractive to customers as they create more trust in the listing and their possible experience. Thus, highly rated listings will generate more customer interaction and revenue for the platform. Collecting feedback from customers is not guaranteed however. Since customers rarely have incentives to do so, and providing such would be expensive to the company, many listings on Airbnb have the potential to be highly rated but are yet to be. With a model that can predict Airbnb listings that will be highly rated, we can recommend listings to customers that they are more likely to enjoy. With more positive experiences, more customers are likely to return and rely on the platform as well. "
